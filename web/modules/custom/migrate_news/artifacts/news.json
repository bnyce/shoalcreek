We are grateful to our colleagues in other city departments and our partners in other organizations who have worked with us in order to help lift that barrier with the Enhanced Library Card.\u201d<br /><br />\nFor many Austin residents, the lack of a government-issued identification can have a negative impact on their quality of life. This is especially true for vulnerable populations such as people experiencing homelessness, formerly incarcerated, and immigrant communities who often do not have access to the paperwork required to obtain a state-issued photo ID.<br /><br />\nAdditionally, people with physical disabilities often face unique barriers when trying to obtain a photo ID. These barriers include lack of access to transportation, limited mobility, and difficulty navigating the application process. IDs are often required for housing, education, healthcare, banking, and the lack of an ID may also deter individuals from reporting crimes.<br /><br />\nSeveral other Texas library systems have established similar Enhanced Library Card programs over the last few years, including San Antonio, San Marcos, Harris County, and Dallas.

TLA believes that individuals have the right to free inquiry and the equally important right to form their own opinions. Freedom in selecting materials is a necessary safeguard to the freedom to read and shall be protected against irresponsible attempts by self-appointed censors to abridge it. Therefore, TLA opposes efforts that restrict the freedom to read through banning, removing, or other forms of restricting access to books or other materials.\u201d</span></span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><span><span><span>In November 2021, the American Library Association\u2019s (ALA) Office for Intellectual Freedom (OIF) reported an \u201cunprecedented volume\u201d in challenges to books in the Fall of 2021. <a href=\"https://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2021/11/american-library-association-opposes-widespread-efforts-censor-books-us\">In a joint statement</a> from the ALA\u2019s Executive Board and the Boards of Directors for all of ALA\u2019s eight divisions, the ALA said:</span></span></span></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><span><span><span>\u201cIn recent months, a few organizations have advanced the proposition that the voices of the marginalized have no place on library shelves. To this end, they have launched campaigns demanding the censorship of books and resources that mirror the lives of those who are gay, queer, or transgender or that tell the stories of persons who are Black, Indigenous, or persons of color\u2026 ALA strongly condemns these acts of censorship and intimidation.\u201d</span></span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><span><span><span>In the weeks that followed these statements, there have been further efforts to ban or censor books in libraries across the country, including here in Central Texas.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>The Austin Public Library stands in agreement with the statements from the ALA and TLA. We also uphold the <a href=\"https://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill\">ALA\u2019s Library Bill of Rights</a>, which holds among other things that library materials should not be removed because of partisan or doctrinal disapproval, and that libraries should challenge censorship. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>The Austin Public Library uses its <a href=\"https://library.austintexas.gov/about-library/materials-selection-policy\">Materials Selection Policy</a> to develop responsive collections.

Studies of libraries in other communities that have eliminated late fines have found that ending late fines actually results in a higher rate of books being returned, as people are less likely to avoid the library if they are not concerned about having to pay money.<br /><br />\nIn 2019, in acknowledgement that monetary library fines are a form of social inequity, the American Library Association passed a resolution encouraging libraries throughout the nation to discontinue fees for overdue library materials as a mechanism to increase library usage and expand access for all populations. Over 400 libraries in the United States have already removed fines for overdue materials.<br /><br />\nEarlier this year, the Austin Library Commission issued a unanimous recommendation to City Council that late fines be eliminated at Austin Public Library.<br /><br />\n\u201cThe Library Commission is very excited for what this change means for ensuring more equitable access to our libraries,\u201d stated Patricia Dabbert, Chair of the Austin Library Commission. \u201cI am grateful for the work my fellow commissioners have done in taking the lead on this issue.\"<br /><br />\nThe move to going fine-free is not retroactive, but the Library is investigating equitable ways to help cardholders with existing fines so that they may continue using their cards.<br /><br />\nIn 2018, the Austin Public Library eliminated fines for overdue children\u2019s materials.
